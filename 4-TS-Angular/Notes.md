## [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
### Why TypesScript?
- JavaScript was introduced as a language for the client side. The development of Node.js has marked JavaScript as an emerging server-side technology too. However, as JavaScript code grows, it tends to get messier, making it difficult to maintain and reuse the code. Moreover, its failure to embrace the features of Object Orientation, strong type checking and compile-time error checks prevents
### What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
- All valid JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. You might get type-checking errors, but that won't stop you from running the resulting JavaScript. While you can go for stricter behavior, that means you're still in control.
- TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel. This JavaScript is clean, simple code which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.JS or in your apps.
### Installing TypeScript
- Via npm (the Node.js package manager)
  - `npm install -g typescript`
  - Check version of npm `npm -v`
  - Check version of TS compiler `tsc -v`
